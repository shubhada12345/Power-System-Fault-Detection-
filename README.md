⚡ ML-Based Fault Detection in Power Distribution Systems
This project presents a machine learning approach to automatically identify and classify faults in electric power systems using real-time electrical data, such as voltage and current phasors.

📌 Project Overview
Modern power distribution systems are vulnerable to faults like:

⚡ Line-to-Ground (LG)

⚡ Line-to-Line (LL)

⚡ Three-Phase Faults (LLL)

Detecting these faults rapidly and accurately is essential for minimizing power outages and maintaining system integrity. Traditional methods often fall short in dynamic conditions and real-time responses.

✅ Objective
